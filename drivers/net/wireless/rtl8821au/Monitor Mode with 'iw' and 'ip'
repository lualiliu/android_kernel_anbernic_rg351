Monitor Mode with 'iw' and 'ip'

2021-01-02

Start by making sure the system recognizes the WiFi interface:

$ sudo iw dev

Note: The output shows the WiFi interface name and the current mode among other things. The interface name may be something like `wlx00c0cafre8ba` and is required for the below commands. The interface name `wlan0` will be used in the instructions below but you need to substitute your interface name.


Take the interface down:

$ sudo ip link set wlan0 down


Set monitor mode:

$ sudo iw wlan0 set monitor control


Bring the interface up:

$ sudo ip link set wlan0 up


Verify the mode has changed:

$ sudo iw dev


Reverting to Managed Mode

Take the interface down:

$ sudo ip link set wlan0 down


Set managed mode:

$ sudo iw wlan0 set type managed


Bring the interface up:

$ sudo ip link set wlan0 up


Verify the mode has changed:

$ sudo iw dev
